## 💡 Usage <a id="usage"></a>

You can clone this repository and run the Python scripts directly.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Louis-Cagnion/Artificial-Intelligence.git AI-Project
cd AI-Project
```

Then create a new Anaconda environment and install the required dependencies:

```bash
# Create environment with Python 3.10
conda create -n ai-env python=3.10
conda activate ai-env

# Install dependencies
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-image tensorflow keras
```

After that, open the scripts in your favorite Python IDE (Spyder, PyCharm, VSCode) and run them.
