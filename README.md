## 👀 Overview <a id="overview"></a>

This repository is a playground for AI experimentation, including:  

- Building and training simple neural networks with Keras/TensorFlow  
- Visualizing the evolution of weights and biases during training  
- Image processing using `scikit-image` (grayscale conversion, cropping, thresholding)  
- Manipulating and analyzing NumPy arrays (standardization, handling NaNs, statistical analysis)  
- Creating plots and visualizations with Matplotlib  
- Testing algorithms, pipelines, and small AI workflows  

It’s designed both for learning and as a portfolio to showcase AI-related experiments.

## ✨ Features <a id="features"></a>

Current features implemented:

- Linear neural network prototypes (single neuron, tracking weights and biases)  
- Gradient descent training (SGD) and visualization  
- Image preprocessing pipelines using `scikit-image`  
- NumPy experiments: sums, counts, unique values, standardization, NaN handling  
- Plotting and visualization of data and functions (quadratic, cubic, trigonometric functions)  
- Automatic generation of multiple plots from datasets  

Future features (planned):

- Multi-layer neural networks with activation functions  
- More advanced optimizers (Adam, RMSProp) and loss tracking  
- Computer vision experiments  
- Integration of external datasets for ML training

Clone the repository:  

```  
git clone git@github.com:Sung-Jinw00/Artificial-Intelligence.git AI-Project  
cd AI-Project  
```  

Open any Python script in your favorite IDE (VSCode, PyCharm, Spyder) and run it.  

Example scripts:  

- `linear_neural_network.py` → trains a simple linear network to learn `y = x*2` and tracks weights/biases  
- `test.py` → experiments with NumPy arrays, plotting, image preprocessing, and statistical analysis  

Requirements:  

- Python 3.10+  
- TensorFlow 2.x  
- Keras  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- scikit-image  

You can install the required packages with:  

```  
pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib scikit-image  
```
